# Netclan-Explorer  
This Android app project is a clone of the main screens of Netclan Explorer UI. NetClan Explorer is a popular app for hyperlocal networking, discovering, connecting, calling, messaging and provides other services.  
Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with or endorsed by NetClan Explorer. The purpose of this clone is to showcase my skills in Android UI development and to learn from an existing and well-designed application.  
Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects.
